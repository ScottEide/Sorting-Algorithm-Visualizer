# Visualization of Sorting Algorithms

### Prerequisites

If you do not already have it, you will need to download and install Java Runtime Environment(JRE) to your machine.  
To check if you have a JRE on your Windows machine, press the windows key + r to open the run line.  Once opened, type in "appwiz.cpl" and hit enter.  
A new window will appear that displays all the programs installed onto your computer. In the search bar, type in "java" and see if anything shows up.  
If you don't see a listing that says "Java 8 Update 231" or if you have a java listing that is a version below 231, then you will need to download the latest JRE.  
You can download Java here: https://www.java.com/en/download/  
Run the executable and follow the instructions on the install wizard.

### Installation

If you only want to run and use the software, click on the "Visualization of Sorting Algorithms.jar" file above and then download it. 
Once it is done downloading, open the file and you'll be all set. The window for the software can take a few seconds to pop up, so please be patient if it isn't instantaneous.
  
  
If you would like to edit or review the code in a development environment, you will first need to go download and install the Eclipse IDE.
